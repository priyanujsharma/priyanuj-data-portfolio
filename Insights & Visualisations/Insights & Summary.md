# 📌 Insights & Summary

This analysis explores key education indicators across Indian states between 2012 and 2016, focusing on dropout rates, gross enrollment ratios (GER), and their correlation with school infrastructure facilities.

## 1️⃣ National-Level Trends – Dropout Rate & Gross Enrollment Ratio

- 📈 From **2012–13 to 2013–14**, the **average dropout rate increased by 14%**, followed by a **7% decrease** in 2014–15.
- 🎒 The **Secondary level** consistently showed the **highest dropout rates**, indicating _significant retention challenges_ during early adolescence.
- 🧒 **Primary** and **Upper Primary** levels recorded dropout rates that were **consistently below the national average** — often nearly **50% lower**.
- 📚 **Higher Secondary** dropout showed _mixed trends_: slightly above average in 2012–14, marginally higher in 2014–15.
- 🔁 There is a **sharp drop (~50%) in dropout rates from Secondary to Higher Secondary**, suggesting that students who reach Class 11 are _more likely to complete school_ — possibly due to _greater academic motivation or career focus_.

---

- 🔄 **GER remained stable** between **2013–14 and 2014–15**, with only a **0.02% increase**.
- 🧮 **Primary GER** remained above **100%**, indicating _early-age or over-age enrollments_.
- 📘 **Upper Primary GER** hovered around **100%**, reflecting _strong participation_ at this level.
- 📉 However, GER **declines sharply** at higher levels:
  - 📊 **~11% drop** from **Upper Primary to Secondary**
  - 📉 **~31% drop** from **Secondary to Higher Secondary**
- 🧵 These declines closely **mirror dropout trends**, reaffirming that **student retention drops significantly after middle school**.

## 🏫 Impact of School Infrastructure on Educational Outcomes

- 🚰 **Water** and ⚡ **Electricity access** are the **strongest predictors of lower dropout**, especially at the **Primary** and **Upper Primary** levels.  
- 👶 This relationship **weakens at higher levels**, suggesting **younger children are more affected by poor basic infrastructure**.

---

- 🚻 **Girls’ and Boys’ Toilets** show a **strong positive correlation with GER** at the **Secondary level**, highlighting the **importance of gender-sensitive sanitation** in improving **adolescent retention**.
- 🔌 **Electricity** and 💧 **Water availability** are positively associated with **GER at the Higher Secondary level**, indicating their role in ensuring **continued enrollment of older students**.

## 🧭 Infrastructure & Dropout Rate: State-Level Insights

- ⚠️ States with the **highest average dropout rates** show significantly **poorer infrastructure**:
  - ⚡ **Electricity**: *60.8%* vs **national average** *71.5%*
  - 💧 **Water**: *89.5%* vs **national average** *94.7%*

---

- ✅ In contrast, states with the **lowest dropout rates** have **best infrastructure access**:
  - ⚡ **Electricity**: *93.8%* (↑ +22.3% than national averages)
  - 💧 **Water**: *99.0%* (↑ +4.3%)
  - 🖥️ **Computers**: *43.5%* (↑ +4.9%)

- 🔗 This indicates access to **basic infrastructure**—especially electricity and water—is strongly linked with **lower dropout rates**, validating the **infrastructure–retention connection**.

---

## 📌 Final Takeaways

- 🎯 **Retention bottlenecks** begin from the **Secondary level**, making this stage a key intervention point.
- 🛠️ **Infrastructure gaps**, particularly in **electricity and water**, are strongly tied to both **dropout rates** and **GER**—especially in younger grades.
- 🚀 Strengthening **basic school infrastructure** in underperforming states is essential to improve both **access and retention** across education levels.
